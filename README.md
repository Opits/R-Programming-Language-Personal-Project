# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using R

## Introduction

This repository contains an R project focused on analyzing COVID-19 data to investigate the effects of age and gender on death rates. The analysis explores claims such as whether older individuals are more likely to die and if gender has any effect on mortality rates. The project uses statistical methods to determine the significance of these factors.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- **scripts/**: Includes the R script (`COVID19_analysis.R`) used for data cleaning, analysis, and statistical testing.
- **output/**: Stores any generated results or figures.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have R installed along with the following package:

- `Hmisc`

You can install the package by running:

```R
install.packages("Hmisc")
